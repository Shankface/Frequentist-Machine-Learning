Project 4: Trees and gradient boosting

Instructions
For this assignment, you will learn how to use and tune a common gradient boosted tree package XGBoost:

First, select one of the datasets from section 10.14 of the test(either California Housing or New Zealand Fish) and replicate the analysis, including the plots. You don't have to do the maps. 

Next, select a dataset of your choice and perform a similar analysis. You can perform classification or regresssion, your choice. This should be a more complicated, and if you want, messier, dataset than the ones we've looked at so far. Use the built-in functions that come with the xgboost package to tune the model and optimize your performance, and determine the feature importance.  As this assignment is more focused on using a library, I will be expecting a more thoughtful analysis of the results.

For some more details on XGBoost, you can have a look at : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.02754v3.pdf and https://medium.com/@gabrieltseng/gradient-boosting-and-xgboost-c306c1bcfaf5
